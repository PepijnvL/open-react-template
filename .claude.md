- ‚ùå DO NOT include: "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
- ‚úÖ Write clean, professional commit messages without AI attribution

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Metadata exports in page.tsx files for SEO

## Project Structure
- `/app` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/components` - React components
- `/public` - Static assets (images, fonts, sitemap.xml)
- `.env.local` - Local environment variables (not committed)

## Important Files
- `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with metadata and analytics
- `components/ui/header.tsx` - Main navigation
- `public/sitemap.xml` - Static sitemap for Google

## Testing with Playwright
**Use Playwright browser automation for:**
- Verifying UI changes after code modifications
- Testing user flows (navigation, forms, CTAs)
- Visual regression testing
- Catching layout/responsiveness issues

**Testing workflow:**
1. Make code changes
2. Use Playwright to navigate to affected pages
3. Take screenshots and verify rendering
4. Test interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
5. Report findings before committing

**When NOT to use Playwright:**
- Simple code-only changes (utilities, helpers)
- Documentation updates
- Changes you can verify by reading code

## WebSearch Usage
**Use WebSearch for:**
- Latest Next.js/React API documentation
- Troubleshooting specific error messages
- Verifying current best practices (especially for rapidly changing tools)
- Finding solutions to version-specific issues

**When NOT to use WebSearch:**
- Project-specific questions (use codebase context)
- Well-established patterns you already know
- Questions answered in this .claude.md file

## General Guidelines
- Think carefully before acting
- Ask clarifying questions if unclear
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep responses concise and direct
- Test UI changes with Playwright when appropriate
