## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations

**Gumloop's Approach**:
- Uses individual DOM elements for countable items
- Likely uses CSS transforms for animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Lazy loading/intersection observers for scroll-triggered animations
- Minimal JavaScript animation loops

**Our Implementation**:
- CSS keyframes for most animations (performant)
- Canvas API for binary matrix (efficient)
- RequestAnimationFrame for counters (correct)
- Framer Motion available but not heavily used (good choice)

### Browser Compatibility

Both implementations use modern CSS features:
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- CSS transforms and animations
- Backdrop-filter for glass effects

All work well in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Next Steps

1. **Add missing components to `/animations-test`**:
   - Rolling number counter with large number
   - Workflow visualization example
   - Binary matrix (subtle version)

2. **Create "professional" variants**:
   - Reduce animation speeds by 30-50%
   - Lower opacity on background effects
   - Add toggle for reduced motion

3. **Build production examples**:
   - Hero section template matching Gumloop's approach
   - Feature section with proper glass cards
   - Stats section with rolling counters

4. **Documentation**:
   - Usage guidelines for each animation
   - "When to use" decision tree
   - Accessibility considerations
