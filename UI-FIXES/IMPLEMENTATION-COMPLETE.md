### 4. User Management Section - Complete Redesign ⭐

- ✅ **More visual** - Icon-based with clear color coding (red for problems, blue for solutions)
- ✅ **Professional** - Matches quality of Merge.dev and Kombo.dev
- ✅ **Faster to understand** - Reduced text, increased visual clarity

**Visual Structure:**
```
┌────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐
│  Without User Mgmt     │   With Kariz          │
│  ════════════════      │   ════════════         │
│  [Red Icon] Problem 1  │   [Blue Icon] Solution │
│  [Red Icon] Problem 2  │   [Blue Icon] Solution │
│  [Red Icon] Problem 3  │   [Blue Icon] Solution │
│  [Red Icon] Problem 4  │   [Blue Icon] Solution │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Glassmorphism cards with gradient backgrounds

- Professional, enterprise feel

**From Merge.dev:**

### Responsive Design
```css
/* Desktop */
.grid-cols-2 → Side by side comparison
